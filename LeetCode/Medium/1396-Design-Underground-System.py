    Same idea generally as the solution above, only difference is in how we store in the second dict
    here we use a list to keep track of all the computed times, so when we want to get an average, we sum up the list and divide by the number 
    of entries.
    I think the above is slightly better since in worst case scenario everybody check in and check out at the same station, so we have to iterate over the entire list in
    our second dict to get the sum. Not much of a difference sha, still O(1)
