# Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. 
# If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

# Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

# Examples:

# Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
# Output: 34
# Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.


# Brute force solution
# Time complexity: O(nlogn) + O(n) = O(nlogn)

class Solution:
    def getSecondLargest(self, arr):

            if arr[i] != largest:
                return arr[i]
        return -1
    

# Better solution
# Time complexity: O(n) + O(n) = O(2n) = O(n)

    def getSecondLargest(self, arr):
        
        largest = sLargest = 0

                largest = n

            return -1
        else:
            return sLargest
        
    
# Optimal solution
# Solution above is O(N) but takes two passes, there is better solution with just one pass
# The optimal solution here takes O(N) in one pass
